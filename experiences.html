                                        <p>The China Undergraduate Mathematical Contest in Modeling (CUMCM) is the largest fundamental discipline competition in China and the world's largest mathematical modeling competition. In 2023, it attracted participation from 1685 colleges and universities/schools, including 59611 teams (54158 undergraduate teams and 5453 vocational teams), with nearly 180,000 participants from China, the United States, Australia, and Malaysia. The competition typically presents practical problems or scenarios, requiring participants to apply mathematical modeling, computational methods, and professional knowledge to analyze and solve problems across various fields such as engineering, science, economics, and the environment. The aim is to assess participants' teamwork, innovative thinking, and problem-solving abilities.</p>

                                    <p>In this competition, I served as the team captain, and we chose Topic A (Establishment and Layout Optimization of Optical Models for Sundials). As it was a more physics-oriented problem, I and my teammates from the Mathematics Department took charge of modeling. We first discussed and determined the general direction and approach to decompose the problem. Then, I was responsible for researching and providing geometric optical analysis for single-face sundials, while the mathematics students handled the mathematical and formulaic aspects of the calculation process, and the polymer science students were in charge of paper writing and graphics. I, as the programming member, utilized MATLAB and Python programming to carry out the computational process. The paper was collaboratively completed by the entire team.</p>

                                    <p>In the 2024 Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM/ICM), our team accepted the challenging Problem B, which involved developing a model to predict the location of a deep-sea exploration submersible in the Aegean Sea. The project aimed to provide a set of safety procedures for Maritime Cruises Mini-Submarines (MCMS), a Greek company, to address potential scenarios such as communication loss between the submersible and the mothership or possible mechanical failures. Our model, based on Newton's second law, incorporated factors such as water flow, seawater density, propulsion force, and resistance. Through Monte Carlo simulation and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) analysis, we provided a reliable reference for the safe operation and effective search of the submersible.</p>
